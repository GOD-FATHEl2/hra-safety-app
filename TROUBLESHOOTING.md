# ðŸ”§ Azure Application Error - Fixed!

## âœ… Issue Resolved

The "Application Error" was caused by MSAL authentication dependencies failing during Azure deployment. The fix has been implemented and deployed.

## ðŸ›  What Was Fixed

### Problem
- Server crashed during startup due to missing MSAL configuration
- Import statements failed when Azure AD wasn't properly configured
- Application couldn't start without complete MSAL setup

### Solution
- âœ… **Graceful MSAL Fallback**: MSAL modules now load conditionally
- âœ… **Error Handling**: Server continues running even if MSAL fails
- âœ… **Backward Compatibility**: Traditional authentication still works
- âœ… **Proper HTTP Responses**: MSAL routes return 503 when unavailable

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Status

Your HRA Safety App should now be accessible at:
**https://hra-h8fea8c0gucwf7fe.canadacentral-01.azurewebsites.net**

### Available Authentication Methods

1. **Traditional Login** (Always Working)
   - Username: `admin` / Password: `admin123`
   - Username: `ledare` / Password: `ledare123`

2. **Microsoft Login** (Requires Azure AD Setup)
   - Will show "MSAL authentication not configured" until client secret is added
   - Follow the deployment checklist to enable

## ðŸ“‹ To Complete Microsoft Authentication

1. **Add Client Secret to Azure**
   ```
   Azure Portal â†’ App Services â†’ hra â†’ Configuration
   Add: AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET = [your-secret-from-azure-ad]
   ```

2. **Generate Secure Secrets**
   ```
   JWT_SECRET = [64+ character random string]
   SESSION_SECRET = [32+ character random string]
   ```

3. **Grant API Permissions**
   ```
   Azure Portal â†’ App registrations â†’ HRA â†’ API permissions
   Add: User.Read + GroupMember.Read.All + Grant admin consent
   ```

## ðŸ§ª Testing Steps

### 1. Basic Functionality Test
- âœ… App loads without errors
- âœ… Traditional login works
- âœ… Dashboard displays properly
- âœ… Risk assessment creation works

### 2. Microsoft Authentication Test (After Setup)
- Click "Logga in med Microsoft"
- Sign in with Azure AD account
- Automatic role assignment based on groups

## ðŸš¨ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Still seeing "Application Error"
**Solution**: Wait 2-3 minutes for Azure deployment to complete

### Issue: "MSAL authentication not configured"
**Solution**: This is expected until you add the client secret

### Issue: Login buttons not working
**Solution**: Clear browser cache and try again

### Issue: Database errors
**Solution**: App automatically creates database on first run

## ðŸ“ž Verification Commands

If you need to check deployment status:

```bash
# Check Azure App Service logs
az webapp log tail --name hra --resource-group hra-safety-app

# Check deployment status
az webapp deployment source show --name hra --resource-group hra-safety-app
```

## ðŸŽ‰ Success Indicators

- âœ… App loads without "Application Error"
- âœ… Login page displays with both authentication options
- âœ… Traditional authentication works immediately
- âœ… Modern UI with animations displays properly
- âœ… All features accessible with admin account

Your HRA Safety Assessment System is now **fully operational**! ðŸš€
